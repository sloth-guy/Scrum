The product owner is one person, not a committee. The product owner may represent the needs of many [[stakeholders]] in the [[product backlog]]. Those wanting to change the [[product backlog]] can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner

For a product owner to be successful, the entire organization must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the [[product backlog]] and through the inspectable [[Increment]] at the [[sprint review]].

## responsibilities
The product owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product, resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.
The product owner is also accountable for effective [[product backlog]] management which includes:
- Developing and explicitly communicating the [[product goal]]
- Creating and clearly communicating [[product backlog]] items
- Ordering [[product backlog]] items
- Ensuring that the [[product goal]] is transparent, visible and understood

Even if the product owner delegates the responsibility to others, he stays accountable.
