[[product backlog]]
[[sprint backlog]]
[[increment]]

Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize [[pillars#transparency|transparency]] of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation. Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances [[pillars#transparency|transparency]] and focus against which progress can be measured: 
- For the [[product backlog]] it is the [[product goal]].
- For the [[sprint backlog]] it is the [[sprint goal]].
- For the Increment it is the [[definition of done]].

These commitments exist to reinforce [[empiricism]] and the Scrum values for the [[MOC - scrum team|Scrum Team]] and their stakeholders.
