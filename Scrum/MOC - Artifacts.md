Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize [[pillars#transparency|transparency]] of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation. Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances [[pillars#transparency|transparency]] and focus against which progress can be measured: 
- For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
- For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
- For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.

These commitments exist to reinforce [[empiricism]] and the Scrum values for the [[MOC - scrum team|Scrum Team]] and their stakeholders.
