# contents
the daily scrum in meant to inspect progress toward the [[sprint goal]] and adapt the [[sprint backlog]] as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. Developers can adjust their plan outside of the daily scrum.

# time-frame
The daily scrum is a 15-minute event. To reduce complexity it is held at the same time and place every working day of the [[sprint]].

# rules
- the event is meant for the developers. If the [[product owner]] or [[scrum master]] are actively working on items in the [[sprint backlog]] they may participate as developers.
- the developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their daily scrum focuses on progress toward the [[sprint goal]] and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.
