# transparency
The emergent Process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work. Important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal [[artifacts]]. [[Artifacts]] that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
Transparency enables [[#inspection]]. [#Inspection] without transparency is misleading and wasteful.

# inspection
The [[Artifacts]] and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detedt potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five [[MOC - events]].
Inspection enables [[#adaptation]]. Inspection without adaptation is pointless.

# adaptation
If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits of if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produces must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made ad soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

A scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through [[#inspection]]
