## members

a Scrum team consist of:
- one [[product owner]]
- one [[scrum master]]
- multiple [[developers]]

there are no sub-teams of hierarchies. 

## values
A Scum Team should be proficient in living five values:
	- **commitment** to achieving an goal
	- **focus** is on the work of the sprint
	- **openness** towards the work and the challenges
	- **respect** for each other to be capable, independent people
	- **courage** to work tough roblems

The team members learn and explore these values as they work with the scrum [[MOC - events]] and [[MOC - Artifacts]]. When a Scrum team embody these Values the [[pillars]] come to live building trust.
