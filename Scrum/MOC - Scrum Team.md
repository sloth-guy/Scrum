## members
A scrum team is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on the [[product goal]] and consist of:
- one [[product owner]]
- one [[scrum master]]
- multiple [[developers]]

## hierarchy
There are no sub-teams of hierarchies. scrum teams are cross-funktional, meaning, the members have all the skills necessary to create value each [[sprint]]. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when and how.

## size
A scrum team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a [[sprint]], typically 10 of fewer people. If a scrum team becomes to large they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same [[product]]

## values
A Scum Team should be proficient in living five values:
	- **commitment** to achieving an goal
	- **focus** is on the work of the sprint
	- **openness** towards the work and the challenges
	- **respect** for each other to be capable, independent people
	- **courage** to work tough roblems

The team members learn and explore these values as they work with the scrum [[MOC - events]] and [[MOC - artifacts]]. When a Scrum team embody these Values the [[pillars]] come to live building trust.
