# members
A scrum team is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on the [[product goal]] and consist of:
- one [[product owner]]
- one [[scrum master]]
- multiple [[developers]]

# hierarchy
There are no sub-teams of hierarchies. scrum teams are [[cross-funktional]]. They are also [[self-managing]].

# size
A scrum team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a [[sprint]], typically 10 of fewer people. If a scrum team becomes to large they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same [[MOC - product]]. Therefore, they should share the same [[product goal]], [[product backlog]] and [[product owner]].

# values
A Scum Team should be proficient in living five values:
	- **commitment** to achieving an goal
	- **focus** is on the work of the sprint
	- **openness** towards the work and the challenges
	- **respect** for each other to be capable, independent people
	- **courage** to work tough roblems

The team members learn and explore these values as they work with the scrum [[MOC - events]] and [[MOC - artifacts]]. When a Scrum team embody these Values the [[pillars]] come to live building trust.

# responsibilities
 The Scrum Team is responsible for all [[MOC - product]]-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work.
