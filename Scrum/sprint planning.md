Sprint planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire [[MOC - scrum team]].

## rules 
- The [[product owner]] ensures that the attendees discuss the most important [[product backlog]] items and how they map to the [[product goal]].
- The [[MOC - scrum team]] may invite other people to attend to provide advice.
- The [[sprint goal]] must be finalized prior to the end of the sprint planning.

## contents
### topic one: Why is this sprint valuable?
The [[product owner]] proposes how the [[product]] could increase its value and utility in the current [[sprint]]. The whole [[MOC - scrum team]] collaborates to define a [[sprint goal]], that communicates why the [[sprint]] is valuable to [[stakeholders]].

### topic two: What can be done this sprint?
Through discussion with the [[product owner]], the [[developers]] select items from the [[product backlog]] to include in the current [[sprint]]. The [[MOC - scrum team]] may refine these items during the process, witch increases understanding and confidence.

### topic three: How will this chosen work get done?
for each selected [[product backlog]] item, the [[developers]] plan the work necessary to create an [[Increment]] that meets the [[definition of done]]. This in often done by decomposing [[product backlog]] items into smaller work items of one day or less. The decision on how to turn [[product backlog]] items into increments of value is the developers choice.

## time-frame
sprint planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hour for a one-month sprint. For shorter sprints the event is usually shorter.
