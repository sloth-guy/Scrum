commitment of [[sprint backlog]]

---

The sprint goal is the single objective for the [[sprint]]. It provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. A single goal for the [[MOC - scrum team]] to work towards creates coherence and focus.

The sprint goal is created during the [[sprint planning]] event and then added to the [[sprint backlog]].

If the work turns out to be different, than they expected, they collaborate with the [[product owner]] to negotiate the scope of the [[sprint backlog]] within the sprint, without affecting the [[sprint goal]].
