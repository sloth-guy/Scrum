Definition:
Scrum is a lightweight framework, that helps people, teams and organization generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement [[Scrum theory]].

In Scrum there are Many different [[MOC-roles|roles]] witch have different purposes.

Scrum combines four formal [[events]] for inspection an adaptation within a containing [[events|event]] (the [[Sprint]]).
These events work, because they implement the empirical [[pillars]].
