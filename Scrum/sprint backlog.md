commitment is [[sprint goal]]

---

The sprint backlog is a plan by and for the [[developers]]. It is a highly viable, real-time picture of the work that the [[developers]] plan to accomplish during the [[sprint]].

The sprint backlog is composed of the [[sprint goal]], the [[product backlog]] items selected for the Sprint, and the plan for delivering the [[increment]].

It should be updated during the [[sprint]] as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the [[daily scrum]].
