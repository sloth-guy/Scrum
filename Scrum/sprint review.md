The purpose of the sprint review is to inspect the outcome of the sprint and determine future adaptations. The [[MOC - scrum team]] presents the result of their work to key [[stakeholders]] and progress toward the [[product goal]].

## contents
The [[MOC - scrum team]] and [[stakeholders]] review what was accomplished in the sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next.
The [[product backlog]] may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The sprint review is a working session. The [[MOC - scrum team]]should not limit it to a presentation.

## time-frame
The sprint review is the second to last event of the sprint and is time boxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month sprint. For shorter sprints, the event is usually shorter.
