The product backlog is a ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the [[MOC - scrum team]].

Product backlog items that can be [[definition of done | done]] by the [[MOC - scrum team]] within one [[sprint]] are deemed ready for selection in a [[sprint planning]] event. The items acquire this degree of [[pillars#transparency]] after refining activities.
Product backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order and size.

The [[developers]] who will be doing the work are responsible for sizing. The Product Owner may influence the [[developers]] by helping them understand and select trade-offs.
