Scrum is a lightweight framework, that helps people, teams and organization generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement [[scrum theory]].

Scrum combines four formal [[MOC - events]] for inspection an adaptation within a containing [[MOC - events|event]] (the [[MOC - sprint]]).
These events work, because they implement the empirical [[pillars]].
