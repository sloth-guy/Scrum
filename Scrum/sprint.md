The Sprint is a container for all the other events. 
A Sprint has a fixed length of one month or less, to create consistency. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

## containments
All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

## rules
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality does not decrease
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
