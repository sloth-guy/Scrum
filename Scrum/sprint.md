The Sprint is a container for all the other events. A Sprint may be considered a small project.

## timeframe
A Sprint has a fixed length of one month or less, to create consistency. When a sprint's horizon is too long, the sprint goal may become invalid, complexity may rise and risk may increase. Shorter sprints may generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

## containments
All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

## rules
- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
- Quality does not decrease
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.
