 commitment of [[Increment]]
 
 ---
 
 The definition of done is a formal description of the state of the [[Increment]] when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

The moment a product backlog item meets the definition of done, an [[Increment]] is born.

The definition of done creates [[pillars#transparency]] by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the [[Increment]].
If a [[product backlog]] item does not meet the definition of done, it cannot be released or even presented at the [[sprint review]]. Instead, it returns to the [[product backlog]] for future consideration.

If the definition of done for an [[Increment]] is part of the standards of the organization, all [[MOC - scrum team|srum teams]] must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the [[MOC - scrum team]] must create a definition of done appropriate for the product.
